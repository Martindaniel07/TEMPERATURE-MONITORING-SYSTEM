The Temperature Monitoring System is an embedded electronics project designed to continuously monitor and display real-time temperature data using a temperature sensor such as LM35, DHT11, or DHT22. The system collects environmental temperature readings and outputs the results on an LCD display or via serial communication to a connected computer. This project demonstrates key embedded system concepts such as analog/digital sensor interfacing, data conversion, and real-time monitoring. The primary goal is to ensure accurate and reliable temperature readings that can be used in various applications such as weather monitoring, smart home automation, and industrial safety systems. Additional features like threshold-based alerts or data logging can also be added to enhance the systemâ€™s functionality. This project provides practical experience with microcontroller programming (using Arduino or similar platforms), sensor integration, and user interface design, making it a strong foundation for learning IoT and embedded development.
